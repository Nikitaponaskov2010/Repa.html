 <p> It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it. Energy can be extracted 
 from external sources, as in the cases of a sailboat, a solar-powered car, or an electric streetcar 
 that uses overhead lines. Energy can also be stored, provided it can be converted on demand and the
 storing medium's energy density and power density are sufficient to meet the vehicle's needs.

Human power is a simple source of energy that requires nothing more 
than humans. Despite the fact that humans cannot exceed 500 W (0.67 hp) 
for meaningful amounts of time,[39] the land speed record for human-powered
 vehicles (unpaced) is 133 km/h (83 mph), as of 2009 on a recumbent bicycle.[40]

The most common type of energy source is fuel. External combustion engines 
can use almost anything that burns as fuel, whilst internal combustion engines 
and rocket engines are designed to burn a specific fuel, typically gasoline, diesel or ethanol.

	<p class="line">Another common medium for storing energy is batteries, which have t
	he advantages of being responsive, useful in a wide range of power levels, environmentally friendly, efficient, simple to install, and easy to maintain. Batteries also facilitate the use of electric motors, which have their own advantages. On the other hand, batteries have low energy densities, short service life, poor performance at extreme temperatures, long charging times, and difficulties with disposal (although they can usually be recycled). Like fuel, batteries store chemical energy and can cause burns and poisoning in event of an accident.[41] Batteries also lose effectiveness with time.[42] The issue of charge time can be resolved by swapping discharged batteries with charged ones;[43] however, this incurs additional hardware costs and may be impractical for larger batteries. Moreover, there must be standard batteries for battery swapping to work at a gas station. Fuel cells are similar to batteries in that they convert from chemical to electrical energy, but have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Electrified rails and overhead cables are a common source of electrical energy on subways, railways, trams, and trolleybuses. Solar energy is a more modern development, and several solar vehicles have been successfully built and tested, including Helios, a solar-powered aircraft.

Nuclear power is a more exclusive form of energy storage, currently limited to large ships and submarines, mostly military. Nuclear energy can be released by a nuclear reactor, nuclear battery, or repeatedly detonating nuclear bombs. There have been two experiments with nuclear-powered aircraft, the Tupolev Tu-119 and the Convair X-6.

Mechanical strain is another method of storing energy, whereby an elastic band or metal spring is deformed and releases energy as it is allowed to return to its ground state. Systems employing elastic materials suffer from hysteresis, and metal springs are too dense to be useful in many cases.[clarification needed]

Flywheels store energy in a spinning mass. Because a light and fast rotor is energetically favorable, flywheels can pose a significant safety hazard. Moreover, flywheels leak energy fairly quickly and affect a vehicle's steering through the gyroscopic effect. They have been used experimentally in gyrobuses.
